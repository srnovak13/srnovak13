[Learning foreign languages helps you learn to code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-learning-a-foreign-language-helps-you-learn-to-code-937e20b351f6/)
I have had a fascination with languages since I was 10 years old. I speak English, French, and Spanish fluently. I have self-taught and speak (at varying degrees) several other languages. 
In my professional life, I have been a chef for the past several years. Creating, finding solutions to challenges, cracking codes, solving puzzles is exciting and consuming to me!
I hope you enjoy my projects, both current and upcoming!
